# b.lock - The blockchain-powered password manager
#### Using encryption and blockchain technology, b.lock is a Chrome extension that helps you manage your passwords in a secure and trustless way such that only you have access to them.

### Note: we have changed our encryption scheme to a more secure one, which is explained in Encryption and Decryption sections below

### Features:
- You can save the login credentials for different websites to b.lock. The saved credentials will be auto-filled when you visit the websites subsequently.
- You can also save "Secret notes" such as bank PIN numbers, metamask seed words,...
- b.lock acts as a Nebulas wallet as well. You can use it to keep NAS or send NAS to other accounts.

### How to use:
* Step 1: Download the chrome extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-password-manager/hjbpkcanpblbdfeoogkbpkbjmacakmjn)
* Step 2: Following the extension’s instructions, create your “keystore” (which is like your master key) and back it up. You can also import your existing Nebulas keystore.
* Step 3: Go to [this link](https://blockproject.io/faucet) and get your free Nebulas coins (which is needed to run b.lock. Don’t worry, $0.0001 worth of the coin is enough to use b.lock for your lifetime. Hence, we are giving it free to you)
* Step 4: Done, you can start using b.lock to save your passwords/secret notes


### How it works
* b.lock uses the [Nebulas blockchain](https://nebulas.io) and each user account is linked to a Nebulas account.
* b.lock uses your Nebulas private key (in other words, the master key) to encrypt your passwords and secret notes, using the AES-256 encryption algorithm.
* b.lock saves the encrypted passwords/secret notes on the Nebulas blockchain.
* Hence, your passwords will be accessible to you anytime and anywhere, as long as you have your private key
* No one but you can decrypt the encrypted passwords. Thus, you are truly in control of your passwords.

##### Encryption
For each password entry, a `domain`, `login` and `password` are encrypted and saved on the Nebulas blockchain. The encryption is as follow:
* Two keys are generated from user's Nebulas private key: `encryptionKey` and `counterGeneratingKey`
```
encryptionKey = sha256(sha256(nebulas_private_key))
counterGeneratingKey = sha256(sha256(nebulas_private_key) + 'b.lock is awesome ' + network)
```
`network` is either 'mainnet' or 'testnet', depending on which Nebulas network is being used by the user.
* "`<domain>:<login>`" is encrypted using CTR mode of the AES256 algorithm:
  * A random and unique `nonce1` in the range from 0 to 1e16 is generated. This means that a random number is generated until it has not been used by the user before.
  * "`<domain>:<login>`" is encrypted with `encryptionKey` as the key and `counterGeneratingKey % nonce1` as the Counter, to produce `encryptedDomainAndLogin`
* Similarly, `password` is also encrypted using the CTR mode of the AES256 algorithm, with another random and unique `nonce2`, to produce `encryptedPassword`
* An entry of `("<encryptedDomainAndLogin>:::<nonce1>", "<encryptedPassword>:::<nonce2>")` is saved on the Nebulas blockchain

##### Decryption
* `encryptedDomainAndLogin` is simply decrypted using the `encryptionKey` as key and `counterGeneratingKey % nonce1` as the Counter.
* `encryptedPassword` is decrypted in a similar way.


### Why blockchain?
* Password managers are essential these days, when we have to manage lots of different passwords (which shouldn't be reused)
* There are lots of potential problems with the existing centralized password managers:
  * Single point of failure: if the server/database goes down, there goes your passwords
  * Trust issue: can you really trust that these closed-source softwares will not just read your passwords?
* b.lock solves all of these problems:
  * The passwords are stored on the decentralized database that is the Nebulas blockchain, hence it will not go down easily
  * The passwords are encrypted by your private key which belongs to only you. You are the only one who can see your saved passwords.
